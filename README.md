# Weather-Trend-Forecasting

 ##Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and forecasting global weather data using a dataset from the "GlobalWeatherRepository.csv". The code is divided into multiple sections including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and time series forecasting using ARIMA models. The primary goal is to handle missing values, remove outliers, normalize the data, and apply machine learning models for weather forecasting.
